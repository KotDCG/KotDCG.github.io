# King of the Dead

_Set Collection via Deck-Building, utilizing a deck of 54 cards. 2-4 players._

## Materials

A deck of standard of 54 (52 + Jokers - aka French) is needed for 2 players. Two decks are needed for 3-4 players. A deck without Jokers could be used for a simpler game.

## Objective

Be the player with the most points at the end of the game. Points are totaled from cards scored (see: Scoring Points).

Cards are distinguished by color and number. Suit does not matter.

## Glossary of Terms

- **The Parade**: The row of cards which players can buy.
- **The Gate**: The deck of cards which fills The Parade.
- **The Well**: The discard pile for The Parade, as well as cards banished from players hands.
- **Run**: Any ordered sequence of three numbered cards from lowest to highest.
- **Royals**: Also referred to as "face cards"; Jacks, Queens, and Kings.

## Setup

1. **Deal starting cards**. Each person starts with Red Ace, 2, 3, 4 and Black A, 2, 3, 4. ( If playing with 3 players, deal a fourth player and set aside. )
2. **Build the Parade**. The Parade is the row of cards which the player can buy to add to their personal deck. Shuffle the remaining cards. Set the cards near the middle of the table - this is referred to as the Gate. Deal 1 face-down card (The Newcomer) next to The Gate. Next, add 2 face-up cards next to the face-down card per player. This will be The Parade. At the end of the Parade, designate an area as a public discard pile. This is known as The Well.

   *Example - 2 players:*

   ```-
   [ Gate ] [ Face down ] [ Face up ] [ Face up ] [ Face up ] [ Face up ] [ Well ]
   ```

3. **Set up play areas**. Each player sets up their play area by shuffling their starting cards and drawing 5. Place the remaining cards face-down in a draw pile, and designate a place for a personal discard pile.
4. **Determine first player**.

## Gameplay

The game is played in rounds. During a round, player takes turns in clockwise order from the first player. At the end of each round, The Parade marches (See: End of Round) and first player shifts clockwise. It may be helpful to find an item to designate the first player.

### Player Turn

Each turn, play any number of cards from your hand by placing them face-up in your play area. When the player is done playing cards, all cards played and remaining cards in your hand go to their discard pile. Then, draw four more cards and end your turn. The player to the left starts their turn.

### Scoring points

Players will score points by completing a run (sequence) of 3 numbered cards (not royals or Joker). The run must be of the same color and start from lowest to highest. The highest card of the run is scored, placing it face-down in the player’s play area. The other cards of the run go into that player’s discard at the end of their turn. There is no benefit to playing a longer run than required. Playing a run is optional.

*It may be a bad idea to score runs with your starting deck at the beginning of the game - you’ll need those to get higher value cards!*

#### Special Rule: Wild Aces

A single Ace can count as a wild in a run, replacing any card except the highest card. Aces can serve as any color. For example, in the run 2 3 4, Ace could replace 2 or 3 but not 4. An Ace could also serve as a number below 2 in the run A 2 3. It cannot play the role of a card above 10. Each run can only contain one Ace.

#### Special Rule: Playing off of The Well

The top card of The Well can be used to complete a run of 3 cards. If the card on top of The Well is the highest card, score that card by placing it face-down in your score pile.

### Buying Cards

Players can combine any number of same-colored numbered cards (2-10) to buy cards from the Parade. Purchased cards go into the player’s discard pile. Red cards buy black cards, and black cards buy red. Total the amount from the played number cards to purchase a Parade card.

Any number of cards can be purchased on a turn, however, a buying card’s value cannot be split to buy multiple cards. Cards from the Parade are purchased one at a time, and cards played to purchase that card are discarded before buying more cards. Any remaining balance does not hold over to the new transaction.

<!-- ? Should Ace just duplicate? Reducing complexity may not make it OP -->
An Ace can duplicate any other number card when using to buy with its value reduced by -1. For example, duplicating a 2 will be a value of 1, duplicating a 10 would value the Ace at 9.

#### Card Costs

- Aces cost 1
- Numbered cards cost the same as their number. Example: Player lays down a Black 3 and Black 4 to purchase a Red 7.
- Royal cards cost 10.
- The Newcomer costs 7 - buying it is a gamble! Any cards used for purchasing from the Parade are discarded to the player’s card immediately.

_Note: The Parade restocks at the end of a round. A player at the end of the round might have no cards to buy. Sorry._

### Jokers

When a single Joker appears in a Parade, the First player must take that Joker and put it on top of their draw pile. If a second Joker shows up in a Parade, the second player in the round must take the Joker and place it on top of their draw pile, if 3 or 4 Jokers, player 3 then 4 does the same. Fill any Jokers taken from The Parade with a new card from The Gate.

If a Joker would be discarded at any point during a player's turn, that player must remove the top card from their draw pile and banish it to The Well. Then, place the Joker in the discard pile of the player to their left. *(This includes the Jack's discard ability - explained in the next section.)*

*Jokers are meddlesome demons which cannot be played on their own. They could however, be leveraged to your advantage (see: Joker Powers).*
