# King of the Dead

_Set Collection via Deck-Building, utilizing a deck of 54 cards. 2-4 players._

## Materials

A deck of standard of 54 (52 + Jokers - aka French) is needed for 2 players. Two decks are needed for 3-4 players. A deck without Jokers could be used for a simpler game.

## Objective

Score the most points by the end of three Parade shuffles. Points are totaled from scored (face-down) cards.

_Note: Cards are distinguished by color and number. Suit does not matter._

## Setup

1. Deal starting cards. Each person starts with Red Ace, 2, 3, 4 and Black A, 2, 3, 4. ( If playing with 3 players, deal a fourth player and set aside. )
2. Build the Parade. The Parade is the row of cards which the player can buy to add to their personal deck. Shuffle the remaining cards. Set the cards near the middle of the table - this is referred to as the Gate. Deal out 1 face down card (The Newcomer) next to The Gate. Next, add 2 face-up cards next to the facedown card per player. This will be The Parade. At the end of the Parade, designate an area as a public discard pile. This is known as The Well.

   *Example:*

   ```-
   [ Gate ] [ Face down ] [ Face up ] [ Face up ] [ Face up ] [ Face up ] [ Well ]
   ```

3. Set up play areas. Each player sets up their play area by shuffling their starting cards and drawing 5. Place the remaining cards face-down in a draw pile, and designate a place for a personal discard.
4. Determine first player.

## Gameplay

The game is played in rounds. During a round, each player taking a turn and moving clockwise from the first player until all players have taken a turn. At the end of each round, The Parade marches (See: End of Round) and first player shifts clockwise. It may be useful to find an item to designate the first player.

### Player Turn

Each turn, the player may play any number of cards from their hand by placing them face up in their play area. All cards which are played are discarded to the player’s personal discard unless otherwise specified. When the player is done playing cards, all remaining cards in their hand go to the discard. The player then draws four more cards and ends their turn. The play move clockwise to the next payer.

### Scoring points

Players will score points by completing a run (sequence) of 3 numbered cards (not royals or Joker). The run must be of the same color and start from lowest to highest. The highest card of the run is scored, placing it face-down in the player’s play area. The other cards of the run go into that player’s discard. There is no benefit to playing a longer run than required. Note: Playing a run is optional.

*It may be a bad idea to score runs with your starting deck at the beginning of the game - you’ll need those to get higher value cards!*

#### Special Rule: Aces

A single Ace can count as a wild in a run provided they are the same color, replacing any card except the highest card. Aces can server as any color. For example, in the run 2 3 4, Ace could replace 2 or 3 but not 4. An Ace could also serve as a number below 2 in the run A 2 3. It cannot play the role of a card above 10. Each run can only have one Ace.

#### Special Rule: Playing off of The Well

The top card of The Well can be used to complete a run of 3 cards. The card on The Well can be scored.

### Buying Cards

Players can combine any number of cards of a certain color 2-10 to buy cards from the Parade. Purchased cards go into the player’s discard pile. Red cards can buy black cards, and black cards can buy red. Total the amount from the played number cards to purchase a Parade card.

<!-- ? Should Ace just duplicate? Reducing complexity may not make it OP -->
An Ace can duplicate any other number card when using to buy with its value reduced by -1. For example, duplicating a 2 will be a value of 1, duplicating a 10 would value the Ace at 9.

#### Card Costs

- Aces cost 1
- Numbered cards cost the same as their number. Example: Player lays down a Black 3 and Black 4 to purchase a Red 7.
- Royal cards cost 10.
- The Newcomer costs 7 - buying it is a gamble! Any cards used for purchasing from the Parade are discarded to the player’s card immediately.

Any number of cards can be purchased on a turn, however, a card’s value cannot be split to buy multiple cards. Cards from the Parade are purchased one at a time, and cards played to purchase that card are discarded before buying the next. Any remaining balance does not hold over.

_Note: The Parade restocks at the end of a round. It may happen that a player at the end of the round has no cards to buy. Sorry._

### Jokers

When a single Joker appears in a Parade, the First player must take that Joker and put it on top of their draw pile. If a second Joker shows up in a Parade, the second player in the round must take the Joker and place it on top of their draw pile, if 3 or 4 Jokers, player 3 then 4 does the same.

If a Joker would be discarded, the player must remove the top card from their draw pile and put it in The Well, then place the Joker in the discard pile of the player to their left.

*Jokers are meddlesome souls which cannot be played on their own. They could however, be leveraged to your advantage (see Joker Powers).*

Flip up The Newcomer face-up. Refill The Parade from The Gate. When The Gate has been depleted, shuffle The Well and place it face-down in the gate.

Move the "first player" clockwise and begin a new round.

## End of the Game

**For two players**, after The Well has been reshuffled **three times** and there are no more cards to fill the Parade, everyone takes on more round. Then the game ends.

**For three or four players**, after The Well has been reshuffled **twice** and there are no more cards to fill the Parade, everyone takes on more round. Then the game ends.

## Calculating Score

Tally the total from the face-down score. In the event of a tie, the player with fewer scored cards wins. If still tied, perform a seance and ask the dead who won.
